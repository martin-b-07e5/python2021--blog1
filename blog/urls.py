"""blog URL Configuration

    The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views.
        For more information please see:
            https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/http/urls/

    Examples:
    Function views
        1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
        2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
    Class-based views
        1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
        2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
    Including another URLconf
        1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
        2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('appblog.urls')),    # Now all the request will directly be handled by the blog app.
]


""" The new URL pattern defined with include
 refers to the URL patterns defined in the blog application
  so that they are included under the blog/ path.

(ðŸ‘‡ no estoy utilizando namespace)
You include these patterns under the namespace blog.
Namespaces have to be unique across your entire project.
Later, you will refer to your blog URLs easily by using the namespace followed by a colon and the URL name,
 for example,
  blog:post_list
  and
  blog:post_detail.

You can learn more about URL namespaces at
 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/http/urls/#url-namespaces.
