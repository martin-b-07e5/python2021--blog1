"""You are telling the Django administration site
     that your model is registered in the site
      using a custom class
       that inherits from ModelAdmin.

    In this class, you can include information about
     how to display the model in the site and
      how to interact with it.

    The list_display attribute
     allows you to set the fields of your model
      that you want to display on the administration object list page.

    The
     @admin.register() decorator
      performs the same function as the
       admin.site.register() function
        that you replaced,
      registering the ModelAdmin class that it decorates.

    As you type the title of a new post, the slug field is filled in automatically.
    You have told Django to prepopulate the slug field with the input of the title field using the prepopulated_fields attribute.
    
    Also, the author field is now displayed with a lookup widget that can scale much better than a drop-down select input when you have thousands of users.
    This is achieved with the raw_id_fields attribute
"""
